 * PyStocks
   - Restructure the repository to use a main __init__.py file that contains
     common exceptions, reference to all of the project's interfaces and
     provide misc methodes that does not fit anywhere else.

 * PortfolioManager
   - Add support for pysqlite without depending on it. I will want to use cPickle
      storage methode when there is no 3rd party applications like pysqlite.

 * YahooFinance.YahooQuoteFinder
   - Enforce data types on all attributes and unit test.
