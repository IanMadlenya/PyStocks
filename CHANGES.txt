 * YahooFinance.YahooQuoteFinder
   - Daily, Yearly ranges are now split in two values by a dictionary ('hi' and 'low).
      this allows easy access of one or another quote.range["daily"]["hi"].

   - Addition of two new attributes and a new category of attributes. The fundamentals 
      "outstanding", "float" (free float) and "restricted" amount of shares can now be obtained
      through YahooQuoteFinder.

 * PortfolioManager
   - A new interface has been created to manage batches of stocks ('buy' transactions).
      It is very limited but useful to anyone who does not require more than fluctuation
      reports from an interface that allows them to log fictive buy/sell transactions of
      securities on multiple stock exchanges. It uses YahooQuoteFinder as his quotation
      service but has been designed to support other stock exchange feeds easily.

      This is the primary item I will be improving in pystocks; I am hoping to release
      PyStocks-0.2 when I will be satisfied with it.
